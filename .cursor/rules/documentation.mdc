# Documentation Rules

## When to Write Documentation

- Document every new feature when it is implemented
- Update documentation when existing features change
- Document breaking changes prominently

## Documentation Structure

All documentation lives in `./docs` directory following this structure:

```
docs/
├── index.md              # Overview and quick start
├── getting-started.md    # Installation and first steps
├── components/           # Component-related docs
│   └── *.md
├── routing/              # Router-related docs
│   └── *.md
└── api/                  # API reference
    └── *.md
```

## Documentation Format

- Use standard Markdown
- Keep explanations concise - avoid stating the obvious
- Include code examples for every feature
- Use TypeScript in all code examples
- Structure each feature doc with:
  1. Brief description (1-2 sentences max)
  2. Code example
  3. Configuration options (if any)

## What NOT to Document

- Implementation details that are self-explanatory from the code
- Obvious behavior that any developer would expect
- Internal/private APIs not meant for public use
